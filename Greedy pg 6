Harshit knows by his resources that this time the winning lottery number is the smallest number whose sum of the digits is S and the number of digits is D. You have to help Harshit and print the winning lottery number.
Input Format
The Input line contains two space-separated integers: S,D
Output Format
The output contains a single integer denoting the winning lottery number
Constraints
1 <= D <= 1000
1 <= S <= 9*D
Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input1:
9 2
Sample Output1:
18
Explanation
There are many other possible numbers like 45, 54, 90, etc with the sum of digits as 9 and number of digits as 2. The smallest of them is 18.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {

	// Write your code here
    int sum,digits;
    cin >> sum >> digits;
    int curr = sum - 1;
    int total = 0;
    int dig = 0;
    int arr[digits+1] = {0};
    while(dig != digits - 1){
        if(curr >= 9){
            arr[dig] = 9;
            curr = curr - arr[dig];
        }
        else{
            arr[dig] = curr;
            curr = curr - arr[dig];
        }
        // cout << arr[dig] << endl;
        dig++;
    }
    arr[dig] = 1+curr;
    // cout << arr[dig] << endl;
    for(int i=dig;i>=0;i--){
        cout << arr[i];
    }
    // cout << endl;
    // cout << arr[0];
}
